  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>Unfortunately I did not preserve,because as soon as Mr.Keen told us that we could skip level 10 of maze I did. </td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independent,because I did not ask for help which would most likely turn into them doing the level for me.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected,because i looked into my scratch work to see what I had done there in similar situations</td>

    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I could have preserved more and tried to complete level 10 instead of giving up as well as trying different methods instead of sticking to ones I was familiar with,because that just ended up giving me the exact same outcomes.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I should learn to preserve more and not give up as soon as I am "allowed" to.this means that I can acquire new skills by overcoming these challenges.</td>
